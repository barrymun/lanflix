## To get started execute the following command:

```bash
yarn run setup
```

## TODO
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] better use of docker caching so that yarn install doesn't install all the packages again
- [ ] support subtitles
- [x] better support for mobile (with hamburger menu) (wip - lots to add)
- [ ] editable directories and files
