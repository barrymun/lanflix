## To get started execute the following command:

```bash
yarn run setup
```

## TODO
- [ ] document adding `env.<>` files to the README
- [ ] better management of installed packages for docker cache layer (so that `yarn install` doesn't install all the packages again)
- [x] i18n
- [ ] support subtitles
- [x] better support for mobile (with hamburger menu) (wip - lots to add)
- [ ] editable directories and files
- [ ] spellcheck (cspell)
